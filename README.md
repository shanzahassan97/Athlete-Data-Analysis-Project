# Athlete-Data-Analysis-Project
This data analysis project utilizes Python for processing, with SQL for data extraction and libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib for data visualization.

## Overview
This project is centered on analyzing athletes' performance data, examining the relationship between key factors such as age, height, weight, sport, country, and their impact on medal outcomes. Leveraging historical Olympic data, the project provides insights into medal distribution patterns across different countries, sports, seasons (Summer and Winter), and athlete demographics.

## Objectives
- **Visualization of Athlete Participation by Sport**: Visualize the number of athletes participating in each sport.
- **Country Medal Winners**: Visualize the countries that won medals in different events.
- **Top Medal-Winning Countries**: Identify and analyze the countries with the highest medal counts.
- **Male vs Female Analysis**: Compare the performance of male and female athletes across various sports.
- **Age vs Medal Count Analysis**: Examine the relationship between age and medal counts across different sports.
- **Physical Attributes Impact**: Explore how attributes like height and weight affect success in specific sports.
- **Country and Season Trends**: Investigate trends in performance by country and season (Summer vs Winter).
- **Win Rate Calculation**: Develop new metrics such as Win Rate (number of medals won compared to total participation).

## Data
The dataset used for this analysis includes the following key attributes:
- **NOC**: National Olympic Committee code representing the athlete's country.
- **Age**: Athlete's age at the time of competition.
- **Height**: Athlete's height in centimeters.
- **Weight**: Athlete's weight in kilograms.
- **Sport**: The sport in which the athlete participated.
- **Medal**: The medal won by the athlete (Gold, Silver, Bronze, or none).
- **Season**: The Olympic season (Summer or Winter).

## Tools & Libraries
The project utilizes the following Python libraries:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For creating visualizations and data plots.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning tasks, particularly Linear Regression modeling.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and exploratory data analysis.

## Key Results & Insights
- **Age and Performance**: Older athletes tend to excel in sports like Equestrian and Sailing, whereas younger athletes dominate in events such as Gymnastics and Swimming.
- **Country Performance**: Certain countries show consistent success in Winter sports, while others are dominant in Summer sports.
- **Impact of Physical Attributes**: A correlation between physical characteristics (height and weight) and athletic success is observed in sports like Basketball and Rowing.
- **Win Rate**: Countries with higher GDPs generally secure more medals, though some lower-GDP countries also perform remarkably well, indicating other contributing factors.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the factors influencing athletic success at the Olympic Games. By analyzing demographic, physical, and performance data, we gain a better understanding of how age, height, weight, and nationality contribute to medal outcomes.

Further work may involve the integration of more complex machine learning models and expanded demographic analysis, including gender and socioeconomic factors.
